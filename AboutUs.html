          We are students of
          <a href="https://www.ada.edu.az/">ADA University</a> and one of our
          major classes is Principles of Information System, which is taught by
          <a

        <div class="what-we-learned">
          <span>From that class we’ve already learned:</span>
          <ul>
            <li>An introduction to Information systems.</li>
            <li>How does computer work: hardware and software.</li>
            <li>What is programming language.</li>
            <li>What is algorithm.</li>
            <li>Database systems and applications.</li>
            <li>Telecommunications and Networks.</li>
            <li>The Internet, Web, Intranets and Extranets.</li>
            <li>Information systems in Organization properties does it have.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            But this knowledge was not sufficient to develop our own website and
            that’s why each member of our team first finished individual HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript learning from Codecademy. You can see the process of learning on this photo:
          </p>

          <div class="code">
              <img src="images/Codecademy.png" alt="" />
          </div>

          <div class="steps">
            <p><strong>Steps of learning:</strong></p>
          </div>

          <div class="process">
              <ol>
                  <li>Learn given theory and get instructions at the end.</li>
                  <li>Execute your code and fix it if it is incorrect.</li>
                  <li>Submit the task and get access to the next lesson.</li>
              </ol>
          </div>

          <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we helped each other to get every
            instruction and understand them better, we did several practices
            together, made sure that we all know the rules correctly. Also, one
            of our mates, Kanan Gubranli, knows these languages better than us,
            so he helped us to cover some details related with syntax of given
            languages. The final step of our preparation was choosing the team
            name and logo. After finishing all preparations and holding the
            event “Hour of Code”(you can get information about it in the page
            “Our Goal”), we decided to start creating this website. We used all
            these three languages, to achieve a high-quality website. As you can
            see, our website has 4 pages and there are the name and logo of our
            team and also name of the page at the top of each of them. “Home
            page” is dedicated for our teammates, so you know us better. On
            other pages, there exist information about our “Hour of Code”
            preparations, as we’ve already mentioned, some general information
            about our team, that you are currently reading, and, moreover, there
            is form for your feedback and you are welcome to leave your
            suggestion or critic in that form. We spent our days on this
            project, tried many versions, colors, sizes to create a visually
            attractive site. We hope that you, our dear reader, will like it!
