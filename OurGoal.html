           <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is "Hour of Code"?</strong><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hour of Code is a global movement by Computer Science Education Week and Code.org reaching tens of millions of students in 180+ countries through a one-hour introduction to computer science and computer programming.</p>
        <p><br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;For the project Hour of Code, Dr.Yusubov divided all the students into teams. After our team members found each other, we created a WhatsApp group and shared our ideas there. We were between 2 schools and chose one of our teammate’s graduations school – Lyceum named after Academician Zarifa Aliyeva. We read all instructions carefully and started discussing each member's responsibility. We connected with the school and chose a suitable time and day: 10th December from 13.25-15.00. There are 20 students, and they are in 9th grade. We chose a tutorial for children, made ppt, and got prepared to introduce everything clearly to them. Furthermore, we prepared certificates for each of them, at the end of our project, we will share them and take pictures.
