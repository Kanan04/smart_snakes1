      Hello! I am first year IT student at ADA University. I am 17 years old. From my childhood, I have a great interest in mathematics,
      algorithms, and other structural things. When I was first faced with
      coding in 8th grade, I was fascinated to work with it. I watched a lot of
      videos and did researches about IT, CS, and CE professions, and in 11th
      grade, I decided to choose one of these majors. Right now, I have a lot of
      aims to do in the future, so I try to learn everything deeply. There are a
      lot of problems in our world nowadays, and I do believe that most of them
      can be solved thanks to technology; therefore I will do my best to improve
      myself, my career, and save this world!
