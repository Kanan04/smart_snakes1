      Hello! I am 18 years old. I started to have an interest
      in computers and programming in the summer of 2020. For eight months, I
      have studied python language and already three months learning C
      programming language. Currently, I examine at ADA University in the
      faculty of information technology. I have a dream to become a successful
      CEO of an IT company. I want my inventions to be helpful and bring joy to
      people, moreover to be environmentally friendly.
